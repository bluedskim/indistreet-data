{"website": "www.psiloveyouband.com", "intro": "Some thoughts from others about our new album, 'Death Dreams':\n\nAt its breathtaking peaks, Death Dreams is the Indie-Rock Record of the Year… - Paste\n\nDeath Dreams is a record of great power: power themes, power chords, power everything. – Pop Matters\n\n…the pair have accumulated enough momentum that they sound ready to bust out of Saulnier’s selfconscious mind and take the rest of the world on, one graceful guitar burst at a time. – AV Club\n\nThis is one of the best Canadian alt-rock albums of 2012. - Postmedia\n\nAt heart, Death Dreams is simply a titanic guitar record, one that draws equally on the proud history of guitar records past from both the indie and classic-rock disciplines. – Toronto Star\n\nDeath Dreams is one of this year’s best indie rock albums. - Prefix\n\n…the perfect example of a \"same but better\" second outing giving fans more of what they love while presenting something new to consider for those who weren't sucked in the first time around. – Exclaim!\n\nYes, Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine and Dinosaur Jr loom large in Death Dreams, but so do Cheap Trick, which is exactly why PS I Love You are far more sincere than the average hipster rock band. -NOW\n\n…it might just be the best Canadian album to come out in 2012. – FFWD\n\na triumph that proves PS I Love You’s expansive talents know no bounds. – The Grid\n\nDeath Dreams almost faultlessly conveys the volatility and incomprehensibility of their particular genius. – No Rip Cord\n\nPancakes...cheeseburgers...tickle. - Pitchfork", "facebook": "psiloveyouband", "genre": "garagerock", "event": [{"venue_id": 241, "title": "캐나다 뚱뚱이와 홀쭉이 인디록 밴드 PS I LOVE YOU-부산", "date": "2012-09-08", "price": "15000", "time": "21:00", "venue": "부산 바이널언더그라운드", "lineup": [{"name": "PS I LOVE YOU", "musician_id": 2040}, {"name": "21SCOTT", "musician_id": 2401}]}, {"venue_id": 406, "title": "캐나다 뚱뚱이와 홀쭉이 인디록 밴드 PS I LOVE YOU", "date": "2012-09-06", "price": "15000", "time": "20:00", "venue": "파우와우 Powwow", "lineup": [{"name": "테이블 피플 (Table People)", "musician_id": 223}, {"name": "티비 옐로우 (TV YELLOW)", "musician_id": 856}, {"name": "PS I LOVE YOU", "musician_id": 2040}]}], "album": [{"songs": ["1.
