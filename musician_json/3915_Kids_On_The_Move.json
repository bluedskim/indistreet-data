The full length clearly potrays their changes over the years, with changes of line ups and their music sense. Kids On The Move consist of five people, Dean, Kaza, Caca, Syahmi and Minn.\n\n They have been constantly on the road, sharing stage with bands such as FC Five, Miles Away, Comeback Kid, The Geeks, Have Heart, Parkway Drive, Ignite and Break Even. With a clear view of their goals, Kids On The Move strive on forward with more plans like playing outside of Asia and doing more tours. Surely there is much to be expect from them, only time will tell.", "facebook": "kotmhc", "genre": "Hardcore", "event": [{"venue_id": 137, "title": "Open Your Eyes Festival 2014", "date": "2014-03-01", "price": "20000", "time": "16:30", "venue": "프리즘홀", "lineup": [{"name": "Look & Listen", "musician_id": 261}, {"name": "스트라이커스 (The Strikers)", "musician_id": 353}, {"name": "더 베거스", "musician_id": 655}, {"name": "나후", "musician_id": 980}, {"name": "Burn My Bridges", "musician_id": 1149}, {"name": "The Geeks", "musician_id": 1409}, {"name": "럭스", "musician_id": 1543}, {"name": "Combative Post", "musician_id": 1736}, {"name": "Animal Anthem", "musician_id": 2314}, {"name": "Things We Say", "musician_id": 2423}, {"name": "더키치스 (The Kitches)", "musician_id": 2573}, {"name": "왓 에버 댓 민즈", "musician_id": 3910}, {"name": "파 프롬 히어", "musician_id": 3911}, {"name": "Victor with Ki", "musician_id": 3914}, {"name": "Kids On The Move", "musician_id": 3915}]}], "regular_musician": [{"name": "The Geeks", "musician_id": 1409, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Kids On The Move", "musician_id": 3915, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Look & Listen", "musician_id": 261, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "왓 에버 댓 민즈", "musician_id": 3910, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "스트라이커스 (The Strikers)", "musician_id": 353, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Combative Post", "musician_id": 1736, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Animal Anthem", "musician_id": 2314, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "럭스", "musician_id": 1543, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Victor with Ki", "musician_id": 3914, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "더키치스 (The Kitches)", "musician_id": 2573, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "더 베거스", "musician_id": 655, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "파 프롬 히어", "musician_id": 3911, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "나후", "musician_id": 980, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Things We Say", "musician_id": 2423, "event_count": 1}, {"name": "Burn My Bridges", "musician_id": 1149, "event_count": 1}], "name": "Kids On The Move", "musician_id": 3915, "member": "Caca, Dean, Min, Azim, Mimin"}
